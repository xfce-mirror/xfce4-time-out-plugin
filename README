What is it?
===========

xfce4-time-out-plugin is a plugin for the Xfce panel. It's a 
comfortable tool for taking a break from computer work every now 
and then. You can define a working interval and whenever time
of this interval has passed your screen is locked for a configurable
amount of time - which gives you enough time to grab a cup of 
coffee, drink a cigarette or even do something healthy like eating, 
exercising, cleaning up or whatever.


Installation
============

The file 'INSTALL' contains generic installation instructions. For more
detailed information, visit the time out plugin website at

How to report bugs?
===================

Bugs should be reported to the Xfce bug tracking system
(http://bugzilla.xfce.org, product 'Xfce Panel Plugins', Component
'Time out plugin'). You will need to create an account for yourself.
